## Idea
Our idea which is consist of a web that will help industries, authorities and communities to identify the hazardous chemicals and all other elements, its possible source and remedy.
- :smile: The first part of this project is a web (through URL) which will be used to see data about heavy metals, minerals and other trace elements from the sample water of River.
- :relaxed: The second part of this project will show the data to the user which can be used for further analysis.
- :globe_with_meridians: The web will also provide database tracing of possible sources of pollution in nearby areas using a geographical map (NASAEARTH).
- :earth_asia: To analyze the source of pollution we are also using NASA earth explorer as it will provide us with the map-based data of the location user searched for.
- :sunglasses: It will also share possible remedies to the user and will inform about less polluted sources in the area.
